Here I made a command that gives out an ongoing ping

Then on the Azure Portal where I created the VMs I go to the network setting of the Linux VM because the on going ping is coming from that IP address.

On the network setting I can find the network security group

After applying the setting from above in the azure portal I can see that the Ping is put on hold in the picture below where it say request time out
